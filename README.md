StreamSmart: Revolutionizing Education through Streaming

Inspired by the rise of popular streaming platforms, StreamSmart is a student-led initiative aimed at transforming
how people learn. Our platform aspires to be the ultimate all-in-one destination for education, bringing together 
instructors from across the globe to provide top-quality learning experiences.

At StreamSmart, our goal is to make learning as engaging and accessible as binge-watching your favorite series.
We aim to empower not only students but individuals of all ages to channel their screen time into upskilling
themselves in a distraction-free environment.

Development Phases: StreamSmart is still in its early development stages, but our vision is clear. Here's what 
we've accomplished so far and what's next:

Phase 1 - Foundational Features (Completed):
StreamSmart currently has a functioning Sign Up, Login, and user authentication system, built using a robust 
MERN stack. For demonstration purposes, we are leveraging content from The Movie Database (TMD).

Phase 2 - Relevant Content Integration:
Our next goal is to introduce meaningful content categories and connect with APIs that will provide educational
resources. This phase will ensure users have access to a variety of subjects and learning paths.

Phase 3 - Instructor Interface and Content Uploads:
We plan to develop a seamless interface that allows instructors to upload, manage, and track the
performance of their courses. Instructors will have the tools to interact with their audience and 
monitor engagement metrics.

Phase 4 - Personalized Learning with AI:
In this phase, we will create course roadmaps and an AI-driven recommendation engine.
These features will guide learners through their educational journey and suggest future learning paths
based on their progress and interests.

Phase 5 - Payment Integration:
The final phase involves establishing a secure payment gateway for transactions between learners, StreamSmart, and 
instructors, creating a sustainable ecosystem for everyone involved.

Though still in development, StreamSmart promises to deliver an immersive, distraction-free learning
platform for users worldwide. Our mission is to make learning both engaging and accessible, allowing 
learners to streamline their education with powerful tools and AI-driven recommendations.
